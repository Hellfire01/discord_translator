# discord translator
This bot is designed to allow people of different cultures and languages to interact with each other as easily as possible<br/>
The bot interfaces itself with Google Translate and allows for a very fast translation in multiple languages without having to leave discord


The bot allows for multiple translations at once allowing for many communities of different languages to communicate all at once on the same text channel<br/>
It also allows for automated translation on dedicated channels. By default only the server owner may set them up but the server owner may set other roles to be able to do so too
